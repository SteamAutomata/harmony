# Events

Lifecycles Events are basically Signals that you can subscribe.
Currently, only Providers can subscribe to Events.
Like in Flamework, when `Harmony:Init()` is called, those events will be called in order:

- OnInit is called, each listener will be invoked and will yield.
  - Very useful for initializing your module and making sure no big errors happens.
- OnStart is called **after** OnInit, a thread will be created for each listener.
  - Good for your while loops
