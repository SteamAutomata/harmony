The simplest example of creating a killbrick, cleaning itself up if the tag is removed.

## Money Service

This is an example for a service handling player currencies. Obviously, clients can't access Providers on the server, so we would need to use the player state!

## Make a custom health system

When making a combat game, you would want to apply armors, apply effects like poison or withering.

Using components, you can add extra behaviors to `Humanoid`, and instead of using `Humanoid:TakeDamage(number)`, you will use `HealthManager:TakeDamage(number, options)` and even `HealthManager:Poison(damage, duration)` which will account armor points and modifiers!

For modifiers, we will use [Boost](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/boost-dynamic-number-manipulation/2786416)! You can get it on the marketplace [here](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/15931813099/Boost%3Fkeyword=&pageNumber=&pagePosition=)!
